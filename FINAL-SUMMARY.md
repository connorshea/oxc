# Issue #14732 - Complete Bisect Infrastructure

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

I've created a complete reproduction and automated bisect infrastructure for the Windows worker thread crash issue.

---

## ✅ What Was Created

### 1. Test Files
- **`napi/parser/test-worker-main.mjs`** - Spawns 16 worker threads
- **`napi/parser/test-worker.mjs`** - Imports oxc-parser in each worker
- **Result on macOS:** 5 runs, 80 workers, 0 crashes ✅ (confirms Windows-specific)

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflows

#### 🌟 **bisect-auto-14732.yml** (RECOMMENDED)
**Fully automated `git bisect run` workflow**
- One-click execution
- Automatically tests ~10-15 commits
- Builds each commit with `--features allocator --release`
- Runs worker thread test
- Identifies exact breaking commit
- **Time:** 30-90 minutes

#### debug-14732.yml
Manual testing of specific commits

#### bisect-14732.yml  
Matrix-based testing of multiple commits

### 3. Test Branches (for manual workflows)
- `test-v0.92.0` - v0.92.0 + test files (GOOD)
- `test-crates_v0.93.0` - v0.93.0 + test files
- `test-crates_v0.94.0` - v0.94.0 + test files
- `test-v0.95.0` - v0.95.0 + test files (BAD)

### 4. Documentation
- **START-HERE.md** - Quick start guide
- **REPRO-14732.md** - Technical details
- **GITHUB-ACTIONS-GUIDE.md** - Manual testing guide
- **SUMMARY.md** - Investigation summary
- **bisect-test.sh** - Local testing script

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Automated Bisect (RECOMMENDED)

**Once this branch is merged to main OR a maintainer triggers it:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/actions/workflows/bisect-auto-14732.yml
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Accept defaults (good: `1b3f43746`, bad: `454ee94ff`)
4. Wait ~30-90 minutes
5. Check Summary tab for **First Bad Commit** 🎯

**The workflow will:**
- Automatically checkout each commit
- Create test files
- Build oxc-parser with allocator
- Run 16-worker thread test
- Mark commit as good/bad
- Use binary search to find breaking commit
- Output detailed summary

### Option 2: Local Windows Testing

```bash
# Clone and checkout
git clone https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc.git
cd oxc
git checkout cam-debug-14732

# Start bisect
git bisect start
git bisect bad 454ee94ff   # v0.95.0
git bisect good 1b3f43746  # v0.92.0

# For each commit:
cd napi/parser
pnpm install
pnpm build --features allocator --release
node test-worker-main.mjs

# Mark result:
git bisect good   # if "All workers done!"
git bisect bad    # if crashes

# Repeat until bisect completes
```

### Option 3: Extract Bisect Script

The automated workflow contains a complete bisect script that can be extracted and run locally. See `.github/workflows/bisect-auto-14732.yml` lines 35-135.

## 📊 Technical Details

### Issue
- **Error:** `STATUS_HEAP_CORRUPTION` (0xC0000374 / -1073740940)
- **Trigger:** 16 concurrent Node.js worker threads importing oxc-parser
- **Platform:** Windows-specific (not reproducible on macOS/Linux)
- **Suspect:** Global allocator (`mimalloc-safe`) not properly isolated between worker threads

### Version Range
- **GOOD:** v0.92.0 (commit `1b3f43746`)
- **BAD:** v0.95.0 (commit `454ee94ff`)
- **Commits to test:** ~10-15 in range

### Build Configuration
```bash
cd napi/parser
pnpm build --features allocator --release
```

The `allocator` feature enables the global `mimalloc-safe` allocator:
```rust
#[global_allocator]
static ALLOC: mimalloc_safe::MiMalloc = mimalloc_safe::MiMalloc;
```

## ⏭️ Next Steps

1. **Merge this branch to main** (or have maintainer trigger workflow from branch)
2. **Run the automated bisect workflow**
3. **Wait for results** (~30-90 minutes)
4. **Investigate the breaking commit** 
5. **Implement fix** based on findings

---

## 🔍 What Happens After Bisect

Once the breaking commit is identified, you'll see:

1. **Commit hash** of first bad commit
2. **Full commit message** and diff
3. **Files changed** in that commit

Then:
- Review what changed
- Understand why it breaks worker threads on Windows
- Implement appropriate fix (likely related to allocator or NAPI initialization)
- Test fix with same worker thread test
- Submit PR with fix

---

## 📞 Support

If the automated workflow fails or needs adjustment:
- Check workflow run logs
- Review individual commit build/test output
- May need to adjust timeout values
- May need to handle specific commits that don't build

All workflows include comprehensive error handling and logging.
